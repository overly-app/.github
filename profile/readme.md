Overly

Overly is a macOS app that lets you summon your favorite AI chatbotsâ€”like ChatGPT, Claude, and othersâ€”using a simple hotkey. Unlike Peek AI (which is built with Electron), Overly is crafted in Swift and leverages native Safari APIs for a lighter, faster, and more integrated experience. Float your AI wherever you wantâ€”no more clunky browser windows or heavy frameworks.

Features
	â€¢	ðŸš€ Instant Hotkey Access: Press your chosen shortcut to bring up a floating AI window, anytime, anywhere.
	â€¢	ðŸªŸ Native macOS Feel: Built with Swift, using Safariâ€™s web APIs for smooth performance and lower resource usage.
	â€¢	ðŸ¤– Supports Multiple AI Services: Load ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI site with a click.
	â€¢	ðŸ–¥ Always on Top: Keep your AI assistant hovering over your workspace, ready to help (or roast your code).
	â€¢	ðŸ”’ Privacy-First: No funny businessâ€”your data stays between you and the AI service.

Why Overly?

Peek AI is cool, but Electron apps can be heavyâ€”like bringing a tank to a scooter race. Overly keeps things lightweight and snappy by using the tools macOS already gives you. Plus, with Safariâ€™s native APIs, you get better integration and less RAM gobbling.
